// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c
num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers
add the 2 number together
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
num1
if (num1 % 2 == 0) 
    print num1 is even
else
    print num1 is odd

Ask for a number (num1)
Take the modulus of num1 by 2
If the result is 0, print to the screen that num1 is even
If the result is not 0, print to the screen that num1 is odd


// Exercise 3:
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.
a) Read in 5 separate numbers.
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five
entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message
describing what they are

_____________A_________________ 

a, b, c, d, e are all numbers read from the terminal
arr[] is an array of numbers to store the values
arr = {a, b, c, d, e}

_____________B_________________

count = 0 // initialize the counter
sum = 0 // initialize the sum of the numbers
while count < 5
    sum = sum + arr[count]
    count = count + 1

avg = (float) (sum / 5) // calculate the average. Use a float to avoid an integer division
print avg to the screen

_____________C_________________

max = arr[0]  // initialize max to the first number of arr
min = arr[0]  // initialize min to the first number of arr
max_pos = 0  // initialize max_pos to the first element of arr
min_pos = 0  // initialize min_pos to the first element of arr

// loop through the array and update max, min, max_pos, and min_pos
for i = 0; i < 5; i = i + 1
    if (arr[i] > max)
        max = arr[i]
        max_pos = i

    if (arr[i] < min)
        min = arr[i]
        min_pos = i

print max, min, max_pos, and min_pos to the screen

_____________D_________________

a)  -ask the user to enter 5 numbers from the terminal
    -store the numbers in an array arr[]

b)  -initialize two variables to store the counter (count) and the sum (sum)
    -using a while loop, add each number in the array to the sum and increment the counter by 1 until the counter reaches 5
    -once the loop is done, calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the array
    -ensure the average is stored in a float variable to avoid an integer division
    -print the average to the screen

c)  -find the maximum and minimum numbers in the array arr[] and their respective positions in the array
    -initialize two variables to the first element in the array (arr[0]) and to store the maximum (max) and minimum numbers (min). 
    -initialize two variables to store the positions of the maximum (max_pos) and minimum (min_pos) numbers which are both set to arr[0]
    -using a for loop, compare each number in the array to the current maximum and minimum numbers
    -if the current number is greater than the current maximum number, update the maximum number (max = arr[i]) and its position (max_pos = i)
    -if the current number is less than the current minimum number, update the minimum number (min = arr[i]) and its position (min_pos = i)
    -once the loop completes, print the maximum, minimum, maximum position, and minimum position to the screen (max, min, max_pos, and min_pos)
